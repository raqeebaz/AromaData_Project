AnomaData: Automated Anomaly Detection for Predictive Maintenance
Project Overview
AnomaData is a machine learning project designed to predict machine breakdowns by detecting anomalies in the data. The project leverages multiple machine learning models and hyperparameter tuning to ensure high accuracy and reliability for predictive maintenance tasks.

Steps in the Project
Data Preparation:

Handled missing values, outliers, and necessary data transformations.
Addressed class imbalance in the dataset using SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique).
Modeling Techniques:

Implemented multiple machine learning models:
Random Forest
Logistic Regression
Applied GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning to select the best parameters for each model.
Model Evaluation:

Evaluated models using:
Precision
Recall
F1-Score
Confusion Matrix
ROC Curve and AUC Score
Results Interpretation:

Compared the performance of the models to select the best one for anomaly detection.
Results and Interpretation
Model Performance
Random Forest:

F1-score: 0.85
Precision: 0.88
Recall: 0.82
AUC: 0.92
Logistic Regression:

F1-score: 0.78
Precision: 0.81
Recall: 0.74
AUC: 0.87
Confusion Matrix
Random Forest shows fewer false negatives, making it more suitable for anomaly detection tasks where missing anomalies can lead to costly machine breakdowns.
ROC Curve
The Random Forest model achieved an AUC score of 0.92, demonstrating its strong ability to differentiate between normal and anomalous cases.
Conclusion
Random Forest was selected as the final model due to its superior performance across multiple metrics.
The model's high precision and recall ensure reliability in detecting anomalies, making it ideal for predictive maintenance.
Future Work
Incorporate more advanced techniques like XGBoost or Neural Networks for further performance improvements.
Explore additional datasets to generalize the model for broader industrial applications.
